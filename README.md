# NecTranfer
This Proof of Concept (PoC) project aims to streamline and automate the New Commerce Experience (NCE) transfer process to address the current challenges associated with manual handling. Currently, transfers are time-intensive and susceptible to human error due to the need for continuous monitoring and verification of status. This PoC focuses on automating key steps in the transfer workflow to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance reliability. 

Starting with endpoint integrations for transfer creation and webhook notifications for transfer completions, the project will then progress through phases that address pre-validations, automated status updates, and, ultimately, the handling of additional edge cases for a fully streamlined process. This initial implementation will demonstrate the feasibility and value of automating the transfer process while outlining areas for future development.
